# Project: [YOUR PROJECT NAME]

## Overview
[One sentence: what this app does]

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python 3.11+ / FastAPI / SQLAlchemy / Pydantic for validation
- **Frontend:** React 18 / Vite / JavaScript
- **Database:** SQLite for development, Postgres for Docker/production
- **Migrations:** Alembic (auto-generate from SQLAlchemy models)
- **Testing:** pytest (backend), Vitest (frontend)
- **Config:** python-dotenv — load from `.env` (never commit `.env`, only `.env.example`)

## Project Structure
```
backend/
  app/
    main.py          # FastAPI app entry point
    database.py      # Database connection and session
    models/          # SQLAlchemy models
    routers/         # API endpoint routers
    schemas/         # Pydantic request/response schemas
frontend/
  src/
    components/      # Reusable UI components
    pages/           # Page-level components (one per route)
    api/             # API client functions
    App.jsx          # Root component with routing
```

## Conventions
- **Backend:** Snake_case for files and functions. Type hints on all function signatures. Pydantic models for all request/response bodies.
- **Frontend:** PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables. One component per file.
- **API:** RESTful routes under `/api/`. Return JSON. Use HTTP status codes correctly (201 for created, 404 for not found, 422 for validation errors).
- **Commits:** Specific `git add <files>` — never `git add .`. Conventional commit messages.

## Key Commands
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
cd backend && python -m pytest
cd backend && alembic upgrade head
cd backend && alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
cd frontend && npm run build
cd frontend && npx vitest run

# Both (Docker)
docker compose up --build
docker compose down
```

## Tracking Files
These files are part of your context — read them when you need project history or status:
- **REQUIREMENTS.md** — Feature checklist by phase. When you complete work, update it to reflect what's done.
- **CHANGELOG.md** — What was built in each phase. Update it at the end of each phase.
- **BUGS.md** — Known issues. When you find or introduce a bug, log it here with what happened and how it was fixed.

When asked to update tracking files, read them first, then make accurate changes. Don't check off items that aren't actually complete.

## What NOT to Do
- Do NOT use `created_at` for business dates (use specific fields like `transaction_date`, `due_date`, etc.)
- Do NOT set CORS to `*` — restrict to `http://localhost:5173` in development
- Do NOT add comments to obvious code
- Do NOT create utility files for one-time operations
- Do NOT use LLM/AI API calls for calculations that can be done with simple functions
